Are you ready?
Nibblin' on sponge cake
Watchin' the sun bake
All of you Parrotheads covered with oil
And feathers, and signs, and pins
Strummin' my six string on my front porch swing
Smell those shrimp, hey they're beginnin' to boil
Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my long lost shaker of salt
Salt, salt, salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
And I know this is somebody's fault
I don't know the reason
Stayed here all season
With nothing to show but that brand new tattoo
Hell yes, it hurts
But it's a real beauty
Oh, I think she might be a Nantucket cutie
Or maybe she's from the Vineyard
I haven't got a clue
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
Salt, salt, salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
I agree with that
And I know it's all you women's fault
Coming soon
Old men in tank tops
Cruisin' the gift shops
The lost verse
Checkin' out chiquitas down by the shore
I found 'em, I found 'em
They dream about weight loss, oh
Wish they could be their own boss
Those three day vacations become such a bore
I blew out my flip flop
Stepped on a pop top
I broke my leg twice, I had to limp on back home
But there's booze in the blender
And soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on
Hang on, hang on, hang on
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
That's where this ship is headed
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
Salt, salt, salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know it's my own damn fault
That's what the therapist said, hell
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
They're always in
And I know it's my own damn fault
Headin' out to San Francisco
For the Labor Day weekend show
I got my Hush Puppies on
I guess I never was meant for glitter rock 'n' roll
And honey, I didn't know that I'd be missin' you so
Come Monday, it'll be alright
Come Monday, I'll be holdin' you tight
I spent four lonely days in a brown L.A haze
And I just want you back by my side
Yes, it's been quite a summer
Rent-a-cars and westbound trains
And now you're off on vacation
Something you tried to explain
And, darlin', since I love you so
That's the reason I just let you go
Come Monday, it'll be alright
Come Monday, I'll be holdin' you tight
I spent four lonely days in a brown L.A haze
And I just want you back by my side
I can't help it honey
You're that much part of me now
Remember that night in Montana
When we said there'd be no room for doubt
I hope you're enjoying the scenery
I know that it's pretty up there
We can go hiking on Tuesday
With you I'd walk anywhere
California has worn me quite thin
I just can't wait to see you again
Come Monday, it'll be all right
Come Monday, I'll be holdin' you tight
I spent four lonely days in a brown L.A haze
And I just want you back by my side
I spent four lonely days in a brown LA haze
And I just want you back by my side
As the son of a son of a sailor
I went out on the sea for adventure
Expanding the view of the captain and crew
Like a man just released from indenture
As a dreamer of dreams and a travelin' man
I have chalked up many a mile
Read dozens of books about heroes and crooks
And I learned much from both of their styles
Son of a son, son of a son
Son of a son of a sailor
Son of a gun, load the last ton
One step ahead of the jailer
Now away in the near future
Southeast of disorder
You can shake the hand of the mango man
As he greets you at the border
And the lady she hails from Trinidad
Island of the spices
Salt for your meat, and cinnamon sweet
And the rum is for all your good vices
Haul the sheet in as we ride on the wind
That our forefathers harnessed before us
Hear the bells ring as the tight rigging sings
It's a son of a gun of a chorus
Where it all ends I can't fathom my friends
If I knew I might toss out my anchor
So I cruise along always searchin' for songs
Not a lawyer a thief or a banker
But a son of a son, son of a son
Son of a son of a sailor
Son of a gun, load the last ton
One step ahead of the jailer
I'm just a son of a son, son of a son
Son of a son of a sailor
The sea's in my veins, my tradition remains
I'm just glad I don't live in a trailer
The sun's dropping out of the picture
Soon be time to move
Hasn't been a real big day
But I don't have a thing to prove
I've still got the old nose rider
I still surf old style
I'll go on out beyond the breakers
Sit alone and rest awhile
There's nothing that I want to do
No place I'm trying to reach
Only time is now more precious to
The oldest surfer on the beach
The oldest surfer on the beach
I stopped searching for perfection
Many waves ago
What really matters is the here and now
And that's about all I know
Catch me a big old roller
Sun setting on the sea
Riding in on her glassy shoulder
The water going gray like me
There's nothing that I want to do
No place I'm trying to reach
Only time is now more precious to
The oldest surfer on the beach
